## 🚀 Getting Started

This project is set up to run in an environment that can directly interpret `.tsx` files via modern browser features like import maps.

To run this project:
1.  Ensure you have a local server that can serve the `index.html` file.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your browser. The necessary scripts and dependencies are loaded via CDN through an import map.

No local installation of Node.js or npm packages is required for the current setup to function in a compatible environment. For deployment to static hosting services like GitHub Pages, a build step using a tool like Vite is recommended.
